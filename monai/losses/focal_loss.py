        Args:
            gamma (float): value of the exponent gamma in the definition of the Focal loss.
            weight (tensor): weights to apply to the voxels of each class. If None no weights are applied.
                This corresponds to the weights `\alpha` in [1].
            reduction (`none|mean|sum`): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
                ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
                ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the batch size in the output,
                ``'sum'``: the output will be summed over the batch dim.
                Default: ``'mean'``.
